### Content-Based Recommender System
Content-based recommender systems do not include datas retrieved from the users other than you. It simply helps you by identifying products that are similar to the product you like.
For example, you have a website that sells stuff online and you dont have a registered user yet, but you still want to recommend products to the visitors of the website. In this case, the content-based recommender system would be an ideal option for you.
#### How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.
#### Cosine Similarity
This type of metric is used to compute the similarity textual data. We convert these textual data in the form of vectors and check for cosine angle between those two vectors if the angle between them is 0. It means they are similar or else they are not. Most used similarity measures when we talk about the similarity between any textual content.
